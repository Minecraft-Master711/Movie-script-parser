About our code:

For character recognition

1) The character which converses a dailiuge is considerd a character. 
2) A string is considered a character if 
a) The line which it is contained in is all upper case and
b) The line does not contain EXT. or INT. keywords
d) It occurs more tahn4 times

 
For recoginsing the genre the following sceme has been implemeted:
1) Words are learnt from various movies of a specific genre and 
and stored in a file [genre-name].txt
2) For more clarity in genre recognistion weights have been alloted to 
	every word of every genre which serves in classification.
For example : blood has lesser weight in horror genre than zombies and ghosts .etc
3) After the wrights are allocated, the file is checked for occurances 
	of the particular word and sum of all weights of all words servers as the 
	measure of score of genre for a particular movie.
4) After every score has been calculated , if a score takes more than 20%
of the total score than it is considered the movie of the particular genre
5) For action score the boundary is 25 % , since words like battle,war occur in almost all movies.
